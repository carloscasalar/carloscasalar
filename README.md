- 👋 Hi, I’m @carloscasalar
- 👀 I’m interested in contributing to open-source projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about engineering team management. These are some articles I've found worthy of reading:
    - [Engineering Management: The Pendulum or the Ladder](https://charity.wtf/2019/01/04/engineering-management-the-pendulum-or-the-ladder/) <= I strongly recommend it If you are wondering if engineering management is for you.
    - [How to lead strategically every day](https://www.lenareinhard.com/articles/how-to-lead-strategically-every-day)
    - [Get your work (and that of your reports) recognized](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on TTRPG-related utilities/libs written in Typescript, javascript or Go.
- 📫 You can reach me on Twitter [@carloscasalar](https://twitter.com/carloscasalar).
- 🧑‍💻 From 14th to 17th Nov, I'll be attending the [open refactoring course](https://www.codium.team/curso-refactoring-a-patrones.html) by [@CodiumTeam](https://twitter.com/codiumteam)
